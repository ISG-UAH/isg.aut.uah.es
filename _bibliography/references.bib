  abstract="Over the last decades the population in developed countries is becoming increasingly older, while the life expectancy is growing supported on medical advances. In despite of such progress, how to support older adults to continue living independently and retaining their current lifestyle is becoming a social problem. Through the careful placement of technological support, elders can continue living in their own homes longer and thus, maintaining and enhancing their quality of life. In this paper we present an AI-based system that integrates a (i) Wireless Sensor Network for receiving information of the environment and the dependent person, (ii) an autonomous robot able to take decisions based on the received information, and (iii) a Web-based system to provide telecare assistance.",

  abstract={Planning is the problem of choosing and organizing a sequence of actions that when applied in a given initial state results in a goal state. However, in real problems unexpected action outcomes may occur and the initial state of the world may not be known with certainty. Incremental contingency planning considers potential failures in a plan and attempts to avoid them by incrementally adding contingency branches to the plan in order to improve the overall probability. The planner focuses on high-probability outcomes and attempts to avoid them by incrementally adding contingency branches to the plan in order to improve the overall probability. Some of these high-probability outcomes might be repairable by runtime replanning so we focus on repairing critical outcomes that cannot be fixed by runtime replanning. For this planning to be successful, we also need high-probability seed plans. In this work, we describe approaches to generating high-probability seed plans and to incremental contingency planning on the critical outcomes.},

Thus, several solutions have been proposed to detect falls, however, none of them achieved a great success mainly because of the need of wearing a recording device. In this paper, we study the use of sound to detect fall events. The advantage of this approach over the traditional ones is that the subject does not require to wear additional devices to monitor his or her activities. Here, we apply machine learning techniques to process sound simulated the most common type of fall for the elderly, i.e., when the foot collides with an obstacle and the trunk hits the ground before using his/her hands to absorb the fall. The results show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved using only a few signal processing techniques.}

They exploit some properties of random numbers to quantify to what extent the observed behavior of the tested sequence approximates the expected one. Given the many sides of randomness, there is not an unique test providing the whole picture, instead a suite of tests assessing different aspects randomness. A robust test suite must include independent tests, otherwise tests would assess the same property, providing redundant information. This paper addresses the independence assessment of a popular test suite named Ent. To this end we generate a large number of pseudo-random numbers with different degrees of randomness by evolving them with a Genetic Algorithm. The numbers are generated to maximize their diversity attending different criteria based on Ent output, used as fitness. We encourage diversity by maximizing and minimizing randomness measures. Once a diverse set of pseudo-random numbers is generated, the Ent test suite is run on them, and their statistics studied by means of a classical correlation analysis. The results show high correlation among some statistics used in the literature, which could be overestimating the quality of their randomness source."

  abstract="The fast technological improvements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has created new scenarios where a swarm of UAVs could operate in a distributed way. This swarm of vehicles needs to be controlled from a set of ground control stations, and new reliable mission planning systems, which should be able to handle the large amount of variables and constraints. This paper presents a new approach where this complex problem has been modelled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and is solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The algorithm has been designed to minimize several variables of the mission, such as the fuel consumption or the makespan among others. The designed fitness function, used by the algorithm, takes into consideration, as a weighted penalty function, the number of constraints fulfilled for each solution. Therefore, the MOGA algorithm is able to manage the number of constraints fulfilled by the selected plan, so it is possible to maximize in the elitism phase of the MOGA the quality of the solutions found. This approach allows to alleviate the computational effort carried out by the CSP solver, finding new solutions from the Pareto front, and therefore reducing the execution time to obtain a solution. In order to test the performance of this new approach 16 different mission scenarios have been designed. The experimental results show that the approach outperforms the convergence of the algorithm in terms of number of generations and runtime.",

  abstract="Due to recent booming of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) technologies, these are being used in many fields involving complex tasks. Some of them involve a high risk to the vehicle driver, such as fire monitoring and rescue tasks, which make UAVs excellent for avoiding human risks. Mission planning for UAVs is the process of planning the locations and actions (loading/dropping a load, taking videos/pictures, acquiring information) for the vehicles, typically over a time period. These vehicles are controlled from ground control stations (GCSs) where human operators use rudimentary systems. This paper presents a new multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving complex mission planning problems involving a team of UAVs and a set of GCSs. A hybrid fitness function has been designed using a constraint satisfaction problem to check whether solutions are valid and Pareto-based measures to look for optimal solutions. The algorithm has been tested on several datasets, optimizing different variables of the mission, such as the makespan, the fuel consumption, and distance. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is able to obtain good solutions; however, as the problem becomes more complex, the optimal solutions also become harder to find.",

    abstract = {Due to the complexity of theoretical approaches in evolutionary computation (EC), research has being largely performed on experimental basis. One popular measure used by the EC community is the success rate (SR), which is used alone or as part of more complex measures such as Koza’s computational effort in genetic programming. A common practice in EC is to report just a punctual estimation of the SR, without additional information about its associated uncertainty. We aim to motivate EC researchers to adopt more rigorous practices when working with SRs. In particular, we introduce the importance of correctly reporting this measure and highlight its binomial nature. Unfortunately, this fact is usually overlooked in the literature. Considering the binomiality of the SR opens the whole corpus of binomial statistics to EA research and practice. In particular, we focus on studying several methods to compute SR confidence intervals, the factors that determine their quality in terms of coverage probability and interval length. Due to its practical interest, we also briefly discuss the number of required runs to build confidence intervals with a certain quality, providing a sound method to set the number of runs, one of the most important experimental settings in EC. Evidence suggests that Wilson is, on average, a reliable and simple method to bound an estimation of SR with confidence intervals, while the standard method, which is quite popular because of its conceptual simplicity, should be avoided in any case. However, other methods can also be of interest under certain circumstances. We encourage to report the number of trials and successes, as well as the interval, to ease further comparability of the results.}

Each level adds additional variables and constraints to the problem. Using previous models, we solve the problem using a Branch and Bound search designed to minimize the fuel consumption and number of UAVs employed in the mission, and the results show how runtime increases as the level of complexity increases in most cases, as expected, but there are some cases where the opposite happens.",

Since their invention, a variety of designs have been proposed, yet most of them have been successfully attacked. In this paper we focus on a new HIP, based on a puzzle solving scheme, created to increase both security and usability: the Capy CAPTCHA. We have analyzed its design, finding some important flaws. Based on them, we propose a low-cost, side-channel attack. Initial results show that the attack is able to break Capy with a 61\% success ratio.},

  abstract={The problem of Mission Planning for a large number of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) can be formulated as a Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem (TCSP). It consists on a set of locations that should visit in different time windows, and the actions that the vehicle can perform based on its features such as the payload, speed or fuel capacity. In this paper, a temporal constraint model is implemented and tested by performing Backtracking search in several missions where its complexity has been incrementally modified. The experimental phase consists on two different phases. On the one hand, several mission simulations containing (n) UAVs using different sensors and characteristics located in different waypoints, and (m) requested tasks varying mission priorities have been carried out. On the other hand, the second experimental phase uses a backtracking algorithm to look through the whole solutions space to measure the scalability of the problem. This scalability has been measured as a relation between the number of tasks to be performed in the mission and the number of UAVs needed to perform it.},

This paper provides a first analysis for mission planning to Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), where sensors and other equipment of UAVs to perform a task are modelled based on Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems (TCSPs). In this model, a set of resources and temporal constraints are designed to represent the main characteristics (task time, fuel consumption, ...) of this kind of aircrafts. Using this simplified TCSP model, and a Branch and Bound (B{\&}B) search algorithm, a set of feasible solutions will be found trying to minimize the fuel cost, flight time spent and the number of UAVs used in the mission. Finally, some experiments will be carried out to validate both the quality of the solutions found and the spent runtime to found them.",

Our solution exploits AI scheduling techniques to manage complex temporal and resource constraints within an integrated power-aware decision-making strategy. The main contributions of this work are the following: (i) we propose a model of the world inspired by the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission concept, a long-range planetary exploration scenario; (ii) we introduce a MSR-inspired scheduling problem called Power Aware Resource Constrained Mars Rover Scheduling (PARC-MRS), and we present an extension of a well-known constraint-based, resource-driven reasoner that returns rover activity plans as solutions of the PARC-MRS; (iii) we present a benchmark instance generator used to create reproducible PARC-MRS problem sets on the basis of the rover models' specifications contained within the ESA's 3DROV simulator; finally, (iv) we conduct an exhaustive experimentation to report the quality of the generated solutions according to both feasibility and makespan optimization criteria.},

This type of analysis has been successfully used in some Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields, in paticular in Metaheuristics. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. In particular, we analyse the statistical properties of the run-time of the A*, Theta* and S-Theta* algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity. Traditionally, the path-planning literature has compared run-times just comparing their mean values. This practice, which unfortunately is quite common in the literature, raises serious concerns from a methodological and statistical point of view. Simple mean comparison provides poorly supported conclusions, and, in general, it can be said that this practice should be avoided.
			After our analysis, we conclude that the time required by these three algorithms follows a lognormal distribution. In low complexity problems, the lognormal distribution looses some accuracy to describe the algorithm run-times. The lognormality of the run-times opens the use of powerful parametric statistics to compare execution times, which could lead to stronger empirical methods.},

These measures, mainly computational effort and number of individuals to be processed, estimate the performance of the algorithm as well as the difficulty of a problem. Although Koza's performance measures have been widely used in the literature, their behaviour is not well known. In this paper we study the accuracy of these measures and advance in the understanding of the factors that influence them. In order to achieve this goal, we report an empirical study that attempts to systematically measure the effects of two variability sources in the estimation of the number of individuals to be processed and the computational effort. The results obtained in those experiments suggests that these measures, in common experimental setups, and under certain circumstances, might have a high relative error.}

  abstract="Many planning and scheduling applications require the ability to deal with uncertainty. Often this uncertainty can be characterized in terms of probability distributions on the initial conditions and on the outcomes of actions. These distributions can be used to guide a planner towards the most likely plan for achieving the goals. This work is focused on developing domain-independent heuristics for probabilistic planning based on this information. The approach is to first search for a low cost deterministic plan using a classical planner. A novel plan graph cost heuristic is used to guide the search towards high probability plans. The resulting plans can be used in a system that handles unexpected outcomes by runtime replanning. The plans can also be incrementally augmented with contingency branches for the most critical action outcomes.",

The ZigBee wireless subsystem will send the information generated by the detectors to the main computer. The movements of all and every one of the attendees will be followed on-line and recorded in a database. Filed information will be useful to know people activity and performance afterward.

    abstract = {The logistic sector raises a number of highly challenging problems. Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e. plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods. In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.},

    abstract = {Run-time analysis is a method that characterizes the run-time behaviour of an algorithm. It has been successfully used to analyse metaheuristics and stochastic local search algorithms. Some studies on genetic programming and related stochastic search algorithms suggested the existence of a rationale behind the run-time behaviour which could be exploited to better understand the algorithm looking at its run-time response. Under that hypothesis, this paper presents empirical evidence suggesting common statistical properties in the run-time of several types of population-based search algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, differential evolution or particle swarm optimization. In this analysis, only the run-time of runs that were able to find a solution are considered; unsuccessful runs are not included in the analysis. The run-time to find a solution, measured by the number of evaluations, of some well-known evolutionary algorithms is empirically obtained, finding that it usually can be approximated using a lognormal distribution, with the exception of some difficult problems, which are better approximated by an exponential. We also show that the algorithm parameter settings might influence the yielding run-time statistical distribution; in particular, when there is no selective pressure, the run-time, measured as the number of evaluations to find a solution, follows a Weibull distribution instead of a lognormal one. Finally, we outline a framework using a simple theoretical discrete-time model, showing that the geometrically distributed run-time is a consequence of the lack of memory in the algorithm.},

Despite the importance of these metrics, and the doubts that they have generated in many authors, their reliability has attracted little research attention, and is still not well understood. The lack of knowledge about these metrics has likely contributed to the decline in their usage in the last years. This paper is an attempt to increase the knowledge about these measures, exploring in which circumstances they are more reliable, providing some clues to improve how they are used, and eventually making their use more justifiable. Specifically, we investigate the amount of uncertainty associated with the measures, taking an analytical and empirical approach and reaching theoretical boundaries to the error. Additionally, a new method to calculate Koza's performance measures is presented. It is shown that these metrics, under common experimental configurations, have an unacceptable error, which can be arbitrary large in certain conditions.},

Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A*, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A* and A* with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta* and S-Theta*). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length.}

abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a powerful technology that enables wireless information storage and control in an economical way. These properties have generated a wide range of applications in different areas. Due to economic and technological constrains, RFID devices are seriously limited, having small or even tiny computational capabilities. This issue is particularly challenging from the security point of view. Security protocols in RFID environments have to deal with strong computational limitations, and classical protocols cannot be used in this context. There have been several attempts to overcome these limitations in the form of new lightweight security protocols designed to be used in very constrained (sometimes called ultra-lightweight) RFID environments. One of these proposals is the David-Prasad ultra-lightweight authentication protocol. This protocol was successfully attacked using a cryptanalysis technique named Tango attack. The capacity of the attack depends on a set of boolean approximations. In this paper, we present an enhanced version of the Tango attack, named Genetic Tango attack, that uses Genetic Programming to design those approximations, easing the generation of automatic cryptanalysis and improving its power compared to a manually designed attack. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this new attack.},

These techniques can be used to help users who have to go to a building with several floors, corridors, and departments to get its right location and orientation. The problem gets more complicated when there are a high number of visitors with temporal constraints. Typically the lack of information and signs to guide the user complicates this task. A typical example is a hospital, where patients have scheduled doctor's appointments and in some cases movement problems (handicaps). A possibility for solving this problem is to equip the building with an intelligent system for user detection and orientation.

		  In this article we present a solution that uses a detection and a location system based on wireless technology and artificial intelligence techniques to plan and inform about the paths the user can follow.}

  abstract = {Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a family of search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural selection and biological evolution. They are able to efficiently exploit historical information in the evolution process to look for optimal solutions or approximate themfor a given problem, achieving excellent performance in optimization problems that involve a large set of dependent variables. Despite the excellent results of GAs, their use may generate new problems. One of them is how to provide a good fitting in the usually large number of parameters that must be tuned to allow a good performance. This paper describes a new platform that is able to extract the Regular Expression that matches a set of examples, using a supervised learning and agent-based framework. In order to do that, GA-based agents decompose the GA execution in a distributed sequence of operations performed by them. The platform has been applied to Language induction problem, for that reason the experiments are focused on the extraction of the regular expression that matches a set of examples. Finally, the paper shows the efficiency of the proposed platform (in terms of fitness value) applied to three case studies: emails, phone numbers and URLs. Moreover, it is described how the codification of the alphabet affects to the performance of the platform.},

	evolution as inspiration to solve search problems. One of the difficulties
	found when working with GA are the several parameters that have to
	be set and the many details that can be tunned in the GA. Usually
	it leads to the execution of several experiments in order to study
	how the GA behaves under different circumstances. In general it requires
	several computational resources and time to code the same algorithm
	with slight differences several times. In this paper we propose a
	framework based on agent technology able to parallelize the experiment

	a description of how this framework can be used in the evolution

  abstract = {Satellite domains are becoming a fashionable area of research within the AI community due to the complexity of the problems that satellite domains need to solve. With the current U.S. and European focus on launching satellites for communication, broadcasting, or localization tasks, among others, the automatic control of these machines becomes an important problem. Many new techniques in both the planning and scheduling fields have been applied successfully, but still much work is left to be done for reliable autonomous architectures. The purpose of this article is to present CONSAT, a real application that plans and schedules the performance of nominal operations in four satellites during the course of a year for a commercial Spanish satellite company, HISPASAT. For this task, we have used an AI domain-independent planner that solves the planning and scheduling problems in the HISPASAT domain thanks to its capability of representing and handling continuous variables, coding functions to obtain the operators' variable values, and the use of control rules to prune the search. We also abstract the approach in order to generalize it to other domains that need an integrated approach to planning and scheduling.},

	from an integration point of view, but there are many situations
	in which this approach is not directly applicable, as information
	is stored in several formats without (implicit or explicit) knowledge
	of its semantics. We present a distributed middleware able to unify
	the access to any arbitrary information source by doing a semantic
	translation of its contents.},

  abstract = {There is a variety of applications that can benefit from the ability to find optimal or good solutions to a proposed problem, automatically. The artificial intelligent (AI) community has been actively involved in efficient problem-solving in complex domains such as military or spacecraft problems with successful results. In this paper, we describe the integration of AI planning techniques with an existing workflow management system. We show how these techniques can improve the overall system functionality and help automate the definition of business processes. The work is based on a short study carried out at BT research laboratories as part of a larger programme that aims to provide technologies for a new generation of business support systems.},
